# ft_transcendence
This final 42 Common Core group project is about creating a website for the mighty Pong contest including features such as a chat system, user accounts with OAuth login, two-factor authentication, and user stats. The website should be a single-page application and use a NestJS backend, a PostgreSQL database, and a TypeScript frontend framework. Security concerns such as password hashing and SQL injection prevention should also be taken into account.
